+ study area map
  + radio button select lake - change extent of maps

  + form to capture study area as point or geojson
  + map to show study area
  + modal map to capture geometry from user's mouse click
  + modal - fetch spatial attributes from existing project

+ space(s) map
  + if study area is a point, re-use coordinates for space (there can
    be only one).  Prompt for space name and description.
  +
  + if polygon, provide radio buttons for:
    + Spaces are points
    + Spaces are polgyons

  + if points, repeat existing wizard
    + all points must be within study area

  + if polygons, re-use study region widget
    + provide input for lat-lon as point
    + text input for geosjon input
    + plot geometry map
    + popup for map canvas - zoomed to lake bounds
    + all polygons must be within the study area
    + space polygons cannot overlap


+ subspace(s) map
  + if spaces are points, re-use coordinates for space (there can be
    only one subpsace for each space).  Prompt for subspace name and
    description.

  + provide radio buttons for:
    + subspaces are points
    + subspaces are polgyons

 + form array for each Space:
  + if subspaces are points,
    + all subspace points must be within study area
    + form array for lat-lon, click-able map

  + if polygons, re-use study region widget
    + provide input for lat-lon as point
    + text input for geosjon input
    + plot geometry map
    + popup for map canvas - zoomed to bounds of associated space (add
      space as polygon layer for context)
    + all polygons must be within the geom of associated space.
    + subspace polygons cannot overlap
